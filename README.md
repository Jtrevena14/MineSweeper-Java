# MineSweeper-Java
A simple java game using 2D Arrays of the classic game, Minesweeper.
This is a very basic version of the game Minesweeper, using 2D arrays, hashmaps, and datatype manipulation.
To play the game you must enter the column number and row number and then the program will highlight the square you selected, if it contains a bomb,
then that results in a loss, if the square contains no adjacent bombs, it will clear out a larger portion of the board that doesn't contain bombs.
The numbers refer to the number of bombs that are adjacent to that certain square, for example: a 3 in a square means there are 3 bombs adjacent to that square.
To win this game you must click every square that does not contain a bomb in it. Bombs are randomized.
I recommend starting by selecting the corners first as they are more likely to have no adjacent bombs.
